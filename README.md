# .NET Core 3 and SourceLink are now broken (gasp!)

This repository contains the steps and script to reproduce a weird problem I
encountered while using `sourcelink` to test .NET assemblies generated by .NET
Core 3. Bear with me, this is obscure and I'm still wrapping my head around
what's changed to introduce this bug.

To see this bug, you need to install .NET Core `3.1`. I used `global.json` with
each step to ensure we're testing the right behaviour, so you might need to
install different SDKs yourself.

## What happened?

With that installed, run the `repro.sh` script at the root of the repository.

You'll see this output:

```
$ ./repro.sh
Tool 'sourcelink' (version '3.1.1') was restored. Available commands: sourcelink

Restore was successful.

```

The last part is the relevant bug report, and this seems to be a combination of:

 - .NET Core 3.x
 - class library targeting multiple platforms
 - generated file with assembly info

## What should happen?

To see what should happen, switch to the `netcore21` branch. I tested this
against .NET Core `2.1.803`:

```
$ ./repro.sh

sourcelink test passed: lib/net45/dotnetcore-sourcelink-test-bug.dll
sourcelink test passed: lib/netstandard2.0/dotnetcore-sourcelink-test-bug.dll
```

## But what is happening?

Why does this file now break SourceLink? That's what I'm trying to figure out
next. Looking at the file itself, it's a generated file that isn't meant to be
in version control anyway:

```c#
$ cat ./obj/Release/netstandard2.0/dotnetcore-sourcelink-test-bug.AssemblyInfo.cs
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// <auto-generated>
//     This code was generated by a tool.
//
//     Changes to this file may cause incorrect behavior and will be lost if
//     the code is regenerated.
// </auto-generated>
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

using System;
using System.Reflection;

[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyCompanyAttribute("dotnetcore-sourcelink-test-bug")]
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyConfigurationAttribute("Release")]
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyFileVersionAttribute("1.0.0.0")]

[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyTitleAttribute("dotnetcore-sourcelink-test-bug")]
[assembly: System.Reflection.AssemblyVersionAttribute("1.0.0.0")]

// Generated by the MSBuild WriteCodeFragment class.
```

What I need to understand:

 - when this was introduced - `3.0.x` or `3.1.x`?
 - why generated files are being looked at by sourcelink?
 - what needs to be done to fix the bug?
